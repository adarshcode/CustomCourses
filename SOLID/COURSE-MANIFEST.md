## How to Use This Course

1. **Start with the README** to understand prerequisites and setup
2. **Follow chapters sequentially** - concepts build upon each other
3. **Run the C# examples** - all code is ready to compile and execute
4. **Refer to the glossary** for unfamiliar terms
5. **Choose a study path** that matches your experience level

## Course Learning Outcomes

By completing this course, you will:
- Understand the four pillars of OOP (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)
- Master all five SOLID principles with practical applications
- Recognize and implement common design patterns
- Write clean, maintainable, and testable code
- Apply refactoring techniques to improve existing code
- Use test-driven development practices
