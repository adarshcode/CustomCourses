# Object-Oriented Programming, SOLID Principles & Clean Code Course

## Course Overview

Welcome to this comprehensive course on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), SOLID principles, and pragmatic coding practices! This course is designed to take you from understanding basic OOP concepts to applying advanced design patterns and clean coding practices in real-world scenarios.

The course follows a systematic progression through 16 carefully crafted chapters, each focusing on a single responsibility and building upon previous concepts. You'll explore fundamental OOP pillars (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction), dive deep into each SOLID principle, learn essential design patterns, and master practical coding principles like KISS, YAGNI, and DRY.

## What Makes This Course Special

- **Multi-Language Approach**: Every concept is demonstrated with complete, runnable examples in C#, C++, and Python
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Each topic includes basic, intermediate, and advanced examples
- **Hands-On Learning**: All code examples are immediately runnable with standard toolchains
- **Practical Focus**: Real-world scenarios and common pitfalls are addressed throughout
- **Single Responsibility Design**: Each chapter focuses on one concept, making learning manageable

## Course Structure

### Part I: OOP Fundamentals (Chapters 1-5)
- What is Object-Oriented Programming?
- Encapsulation: Protecting Your Data
- Abstraction: Hiding Complexity
- Inheritance: Building on Existing Code
- Polymorphism: One Interface, Many Forms

### Part II: SOLID Principles (Chapters 6-10)
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

### Part III: Design Patterns & Practices (Chapters 11-16)
- Essential Design Patterns
- SOLID in Practice: Building a Complete System
- KISS, YAGNI, DRY: The Pragmatic Trio
- Clean Code Basics: Writing Readable Code
- Testing & TDD for OOP
- Refactoring: From Bad Code to SOLID Code

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge in at least one language
- Understanding of variables, functions, and basic control structures
- Familiarity with command-line tools for compiling/running programs

## Required Tools

### C# Examples
- .NET SDK 6.0 or later
- Any text editor or IDE (Visual Studio, VS Code, etc.)

### C++ Examples
- GCC compiler with C++17 support
- Any text editor or IDE

### Python Examples
- Python 3.9 or later
- Any text editor or IDE

## How to Use This Course

1. **Read each chapter sequentially** - concepts build upon each other
2. **Run all code examples** - hands-on practice is essential
3. **Complete the exercises** - they reinforce learning
4. **Check your understanding** - use the chapter checklists
5. **Experiment** - modify examples to see what happens

## Study Paths

### Absolute Beginners
Start with Chapter 1 and work through sequentially. Focus on basic examples first, then move to intermediate examples as you become comfortable.

### Intermediate Developers
If you know basic OOP, you can start with Chapter 6 (SOLID principles). Review earlier chapters if needed.

### Interview Preparation
Focus on Chapters 6-12 for design principles and patterns. Chapters 15-16 are excellent for discussing code quality.

## Getting Help

Each chapter includes:
- Clear explanations at two levels (beginner and developer)
- Complete, runnable code examples
- Expected outputs for verification
- Practice exercises with hints
- Self-assessment checklists
