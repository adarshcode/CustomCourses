# Object-Oriented Programming, SOLID Principles & Clean Code Course

## Course Overview

Welcome to this comprehensive course on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), SOLID principles, and pragmatic coding practices! This course is designed to take you from understanding basic OOP concepts to applying advanced design patterns and clean coding practices in real-world scenarios.

The course follows a systematic progression through 16 carefully crafted chapters, each focusing on a single responsibility and building upon previous concepts. You'll explore fundamental OOP pillars (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction), dive deep into each SOLID principle, learn essential design patterns, and master practical coding principles like KISS, YAGNI, and DRY.

## What Makes This Course Special

- **C# Focus**: Every concept is demonstrated with complete, runnable C# examples
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Each topic includes basic, intermediate, and advanced examples  
- **Hands-On Learning**: All code examples are immediately runnable with .NET SDK
- **Practical Focus**: Real-world scenarios and common pitfalls are addressed throughout
- **Single Responsibility Design**: Each chapter focuses on one concept, making learning manageable

## Course Structure

### Part I: OOP Fundamentals (Chapters 1-5)
- What is Object-Oriented Programming?
- Encapsulation: Protecting Your Data
- Abstraction: Hiding Complexity
- Inheritance: Building on Existing Code
- Polymorphism: One Interface, Many Forms

### Part II: SOLID Principles (Chapters 6-10)
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

### Part III: Design Patterns & Practices (Chapters 11-16)
- Essential Design Patterns
- SOLID in Practice: Building a Complete System
- KISS, YAGNI, DRY: The Pragmatic Trio
- Clean Code Basics: Writing Readable Code
- Testing & TDD for OOP
- Refactoring: From Bad Code to SOLID Code

## Prerequisites

- **Intermediate programming knowledge** in C#, Java, Python, or similar OOP language
- **Experience with classes and objects** - you should be comfortable creating and using classes
- **Understanding of basic OOP concepts** like inheritance and method overriding
- **Familiarity with interfaces or abstract classes** (helpful but not required)
- **Basic knowledge of software development** - you've built applications before
- **.NET SDK 6.0 or later** for running C# examples
- Basic C# syntax knowledge (variables, methods, classes) is helpful but not required

## Required Tools

### C# Development Environment
- .NET SDK 6.0 or later
- Any text editor or IDE (Visual Studio, VS Code, JetBrains Rider, etc.)

### Installation Steps
1. Download and install .NET SDK from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
2. Verify installation: `dotnet --version`
3. Choose your preferred editor/IDE
4. Clone or download the course materials

## How to Use This Course

1. **Read each chapter sequentially** - concepts build upon each other
2. **Run all C# code examples** - hands-on practice is essential
3. **Complete the exercises** - they reinforce learning
4. **Check your understanding** - use the chapter checklists
5. **Experiment** - modify examples to see what happens

## Running the Examples

Each chapter includes a corresponding C# file with complete examples:

```bash
# Navigate to the code-examples directory
cd code-examples

# Compile and run any chapter example
dotnet run --project chapter-01.cs

# Or compile first, then run
csc chapter-01.cs
./chapter-01.exe
```

## Study Paths

### New to SOLID Principles
Start with Chapter 1 for OOP review, then work through sequentially. Focus on understanding design principles and recognizing code smells.

### Experienced Developers  
If you know OOP well, you can start with Chapter 6 (SOLID principles). Review earlier chapters for C# syntax and advanced examples.

### System Design Interview Preparation
Focus on Chapters 6-12 for design principles and patterns. Chapters 15-16 are excellent for discussing code quality.

## Getting Help

Each chapter includes:
- Clear explanations at multiple levels
- Complete, runnable C# code examples
- Expected outputs for verification
- Practice exercises with hints
- Self-assessment checklists

## Course Files

All course materials are organized in:
- `chapters/` - Individual chapter content
- `code-examples/` - All runnable C# files organized by chapter
- `COURSE-MANIFEST.md` - Complete file listing and navigation
- `GLOSSARY.md` - Technical terms and definitions
