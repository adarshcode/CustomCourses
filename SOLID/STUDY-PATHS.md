### Phase 3: SOLID Principles (Weeks 7-10)
7. **Chapter 6**: Single Responsibility Principle
8. **Chapter 13**: KISS, YAGNI, DRY (easier concepts)
9. **Chapter 7**: Open/Closed Principle
10. **Chapter 8**: Liskov Substitution Principle
11. **Chapter 9**: Interface Segregation Principle
12. **Chapter 10**: Dependency Inversion Principle

### Phase 4: Clean Practices (Weeks 11-12)
13. **Chapter 14**: Clean Code Basics
14. **Chapter 15**: Testing & TDD Basics
15. **Chapter 16**: Refactoring
16. **Chapter 12**: SOLID in Practice (if time permits)

**Skip for now**: Chapter 11 (Design Patterns) - return to this after gaining more experience

**Recommended Timeline**: 3-4 weeks (intensive study)

### Week 1: SOLID Mastery
- **Chapters 6-10**: All SOLID principles
- Focus on understanding when and why to apply each principle
- Be able to identify violations in existing code
- Practice explaining principles with real-world analogies

### Week 2: Design Patterns & Architecture
- **Chapter 11**: Essential Design Patterns

## For Self-Paced Advanced Learning

**No Timeline**: Study based on current needs

### Architecture-Focused Path
1. Chapter 12 (SOLID in Practice)
2. Chapter 11 (Design Patterns)
3. Chapters 6-10 (SOLID Principles) - as reference
4. Chapter 16 (Refactoring) - for improving existing systems

### Code Quality-Focused Path
1. Chapter 14 (Clean Code Basics)
2. Chapter 13 (KISS, YAGNI, DRY)
3. Chapter 15 (Testing & TDD)
4. Chapter 16 (Refactoring)
5. Chapters 6-10 (SOLID) - as needed

### Teaching/Mentoring Path
1. Start with Chapter 1 (to understand beginner perspective)
2. Study all child-friendly explanations
3. Work through all difficulty levels
4. Focus on exercises and common mistakes
5. Practice explaining concepts without jargon

## General Study Tips

### For All Levels:
- **Always run the code examples** - don't just read them
- **Complete the exercises** - they reinforce learning
- **Use the checklists** - ensure you truly understand before moving on
- **Take notes** - write down key insights in your own words

### Language-Specific Recommendations:
- **Focus on one language initially** - switch languages after mastering concepts
- **C# learners**: Great for understanding enterprise patterns
- **C++ learners**: Excellent for understanding memory management and performance
- **Python learners**: Best for rapid prototyping and algorithm focus

### Red Flags (When to Slow Down):
- Can't explain a concept in simple terms
- Struggling with basic examples
- Skipping exercises due to difficulty
- Not understanding why principles matter

### Green Flags (When to Accelerate):
- Easily completing exercises
- Seeing applications in your current work
- Spotting violations in existing codebases
- Explaining concepts to others successfully

Remember: **Understanding is more important than speed**. It's better to deeply understand fewer concepts than to superficially cover everything.
